"Netflix Data Analysis Project: Exploring and extracting insights from a dataset containing Netflix content information, including trends in release years, top directors, sentiment analysis of descriptions, and more."
Because Netflix has shifted its business model from on-demand DVD movie rental to focusing heavily on the production of their original series, the platform has continually focused on changing business needs, making it possible for us to examine a large amount of data and models from Netflix.
Among the most crucial jobs that we can examine with Netflix data are:
1]Recognize the stuff that is provided. 
2]recognize the parallels between the content. 
3]recognize the connections between directors and actors.
what precisely Netflix is concentrating on as well as sentiment analysis of its content.TV series and movies that are available for streaming on Netflix as of 2019 make up the dataset I utilize for the Netflix data analytics task. Flixable, a search engine for publicly available third-party research, provides the dataset.
